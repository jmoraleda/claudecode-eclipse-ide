/* viewstate.js — the view's layout, remembered across Eclipse restarts.

   STORED: the working roots, each root's conversations (session id + title), which
   conversation was active, where each was scrolled, and whether the root row was
   collapsed. NOT stored: any conversation content — the transcript already lives in
   the CLI's own JSONL, and a conversation's model / effort / thinking / permission
   mode already round-trip through _loadSessionPrefs when it loads. This blob holds
   ids and flags only, so it stays small enough to sit in the workbench's own state.

   Java never parses it: ClaudeGuiView pushes the string into the view's IMemento and
   hands it back at boot (see ClaudeGuiView#viewStateJson), so the shape stays a JS
   concern. Everything read back is treated as optional — a blob written by an older
   build, or a half-written one, must never be able to stop the view from opening. */
