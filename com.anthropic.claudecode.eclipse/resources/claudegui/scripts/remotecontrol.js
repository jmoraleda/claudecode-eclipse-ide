   phone lands in all of them.

   It is not teleport. Teleport takes a one-way copy of a web conversation and
   then diverges from it; this keeps one conversation with several front doors.

   The toggle is a control request the CLI answers asynchronously, so nothing is
   rendered optimistically — every line below is written when the CLI confirms,
