/* find.js — Find-in-conversation: a per-tab find bar over the active tab's own .pane.
   Ctrl+F (rebindable) is wired through ClaudeGuiView#toggleFindInConversation, which
   calls window.toggleFindBar(); Escape closes it via the usual registerOverlayCancel
   path, same as every other page-local overlay (History, the model picker, …).

   Matches are painted with the CSS Custom Highlight API (CSS.highlights) rather than by
   wrapping matched text in <mark> elements: a wrapped-node approach would mean rebuilding
   the matched text nodes on every keystroke, which risks corrupting markdown-rendered
   markup (inline code, links, bold) and can clobber a live streaming turn's own DOM
   mutations. Highlights paint Ranges without touching the DOM at all, so re-searching is
   just "throw away the old Ranges and build new ones" with nothing to undo.

   Design: only what's on screen is ever highlighted, and it follows the scroll position
   live. A long conversation made typing in the find box scan every text node in the whole
   transcript on every keystroke, and held a live Range for every match found anywhere —
   both costs scale with conversation length and match count instead of with what's
   actually useful to look at. Since the user only cares about matches near what they're
   currently reading, every re-highlight (typing, scrolling, stepping) only ever touches
   the `.turn`s intersecting the viewport — bounded by screen size, not conversation
   length or match density. There is deliberately no "N of M" count: with no fixed search
   window, there both isn't a stable "M" to report and it invites reading a viewport-
   relative position as if it were the match's place in the whole conversation.

   Enter/Shift+Enter still search the WHOLE document for the next/previous match, same as
   a browser's own Ctrl+F — they just don't pre-collect the whole document's matches to do
   it: nextMatch walks outward turn-by-turn (see turnSibling) from wherever the active
   match is (or the near/far edge of the viewport, if none is active yet) until it finds
   one, bounded by how far away that match actually is rather than by conversation length.
   Typing can also jump the view, via the same probe: if what you just typed has no match
   on screen but does exist elsewhere, reHighlight shows it immediately (goToMatch) rather
   than making you press Enter to find out — but only the first time per query, so editing
   a query whose match is already off-screen doesn't re-jump the view on every keystroke.

   State (query, active match, open/closed) is per-tab, parked/restored by
   onFindTabSwitch — called from tabs.js#switchTab exactly like the composer draft. */

 *
 *  `allowJump` must be false for any call triggered BY a scroll (onFindScroll) or by a

 *
 *  An empty viewport does NOT by itself mean an empty conversation — the query may

 *  This probe (and the "Not found" it can produce) only runs when allowJump is true —

 *  finds every match anywhere in that turn regardless of how much of it is actually
 *  scrolled into view, so filtering by TURN intersection alone could still collect (and
 *  paint, as live Ranges) hundreds of matches sitting above/below the visible slice of
 *  that one turn — the exact live-Range cost this whole design exists to bound. Filtering
 *  each match's own rect against the viewport, not just its turn's, is what actually
 *  keeps the live set screen-sized regardless of how a turn's content is laid out.
 *
 *  Note what this does NOT bound: matchesInTurn itself still walks and builds a Range for
 *  EVERY match in a turn that intersects the viewport at all, even ones nowhere near the
 *  visible slice (a turn far taller, or with a much wider single line, than the screen).
 *  Each Range then costs one getClientRects() call here to test visibility. If a turn has
 *  many matches but few are actually visible (e.g. one very long line, most of it
 *  scrolled out of view horizontally, with dozens of matches packed into it), that scan
 *  cost is real and unbounded by FIND_VIEWPORT_MATCH_CAP below — the cap only stops
 *  collecting once enough VISIBLE ones are found, it can't skip the invisible ones without
 *  measuring them first. Bounding that scan itself would need pruning by position before
 *  ever calling getClientRects, which is a real redesign; not attempted here. */
