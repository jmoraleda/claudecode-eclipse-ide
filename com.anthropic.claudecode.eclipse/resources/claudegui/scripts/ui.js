/* macOS: an arrow key the caret can't act on inserts U+1D (ASCII GROUP SEPARATOR)
   into the composer, which renders as a box. On the Mac the SWT Browser is WebKit
   under Cocoa: a key WebKit reports as unhandled falls back to AppKit's insertText:
   with the raw NSEvent character, and the arrows carry a control character rather
   than nothing. It only shows at the boundaries (Right at the end of the text, Left
   at the start) because anywhere else the caret really moves and the key is consumed.
   Windows goes through WebView2 and Linux through WebKitGTK, where the arrows carry
   no character at all, so this is inert on both -- the guard is keyed to the arrow
   keydown that precedes the insert, not to the platform.

   Gated on that preceding arrow keydown rather than filtering the range outright, so
   a PASTE containing a control character is left alone everywhere. beforeinput is
   cancelable, so the character never lands -- no insert-then-delete, no flicker, no
   caret to restore. Verified against a real macOS repro: keydown(ArrowRight) ->
   textInput -> beforeinput{inputType:"insertText",data:"\u001d"} -> input. */

/* A key bound to one of Eclipse's org.eclipse.ui.edit.* commands (issue #97): on GTK,
   the dispatcher consuming the keystroke (doit=false) doesn't stop WebKit from ALSO
   inserting it as text once the key carries a plain, unmodified character -- an Emacs
   Ctrl+X H both selects all AND types "h" into the composer.

   The natural fix would be to arm a guard before running the command and have it
   preventDefault() the stray beforeinput. That does NOT work: browser.execute() on
   WebKitGTK queues the injected script behind the page's own pending key processing,
   so the arm call lands in the page strictly AFTER the stray keydown/beforeinput for
   that same keystroke has already run and inserted the character (confirmed against a
   live GTK build -- the arm log line comes after the insert's beforeinput line, not
   before). There is no preventing an insert that already happened by the time we're
   able to say anything about it.

   So this undoes it instead. Every single-character insertText beforeinput on the
   composer is recorded (character + position); when the command's own arm call
   arrives afterward carrying the SAME character, the just-inserted character at that
   recorded position is deleted. Both the record and the arm are one-shot and scoped
   to the exact character, so ordinary typing (no arm ever follows it) and an edit
   command that inserts nothing (e.g. Delete, which never arms -- see
   activateEditHandler) are both untouched. execCommand('delete') is used rather than
   setRangeText so the removal stays on the textarea's native undo stack, same as
   ccDeleteSelection.

   Arming (and therefore undoing) is refused unless the composer already has focus.
   selectAll works on the transcript too when the composer isn't focused (see
   ccSelectAll/ccField), and a stray GTK insert can only ever land in whatever field
   the keystroke's own focus was in -- so an edit op that ran against the transcript
   never gets a beforeinput on #input to record, and there is nothing here to undo. */
